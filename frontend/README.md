# Frontend Setup

This React app uses Vite and Tailwind CSS.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development server proxies API requests to `http://localhost:8000`, so make
sure the backend is running on that port before starting the frontend. On start
it connects to the backend at the same host and loads project 1.
